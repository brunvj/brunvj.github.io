Welcome to my website, the name's Vincente (or Vinny for short)! I am an East Coast based Computer Engineer looking for my dream job. In freshman year of high school, I took a career quiz and got over 200 career options to decide on. Out of them all, only Computer Hardware Engineering stood out. I truly did not comprehend what on earth a Computer Hardware Engineer did but I loved being technically inclined, so I set my sights high and 6 years later, after rigorous work, I got a Bachelors in Electrical & Computer Engineering with a focus in Computer Engineering. I am very thankful to say, I love freshman Vinny's career choice.
